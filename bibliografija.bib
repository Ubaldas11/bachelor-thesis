@phdthesis{Baars2016,
abstract = {Executive Summary With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor-mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub-lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans-actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi-viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes.},
