abstract = {This paper presents a survey of identity management from the perspectives of development stages and functions variety of Identity Management. The definition and core concepts of identity and identity management have been discussed deeply. Identity Management models including isolated model, centralized model, and federated model are grouped by components varying and functions changing. Based on the transformation of core design principles, paradigms of identity management are classified into network centric paradigm, service centric paradigm, and user centric paradigm. Comparisons of these paradigms and models have been presented. And we give a rough classification of current systems to the corresponding paradigms and models.},

@inproceedings{Myllyniemi2006,
abstract = {Nowadays, there is a vast amount of work going on in the field of network identity management. Many people in many organizations want to solve the problem of users having to manage countless user accounts, each of which have their own identifier and authentication credentials for a user, as well as a set of attributes that describe the user's identity. The problem applies to the service provider side as well: how to enable collaboration between different services by allowing the users combine two or more services using only one iden-tity, so that the companies offering the services could profit from such collaboration? The user's identities at the service providers either need to be linked, or the user has to have a single identity which he or she can use with various services. In this paper, we present some of the current solutions to the identity management problem, and introduce three cri-teria for comparing identity management systems. The sys-tems discussed are roughly divided into three subcategories to make some kind of comparison possible. Systems in one subcategory have more or less a common viewpoint to the identity management problem, whereas two systems in dif-ferent subcategories might only have one thing in common: they attempt to solve the Web identity management problem in some way.},

@phdthesis{Baars2016,
abstract = {Executive Summary With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor-mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub-lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans-actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi-viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Web applications forces users to manage multiple user names and passwords daily. Various single sign-on solutions that depend upon PKI, Kerberos, or password-store have been proposed, but they require client side infrastructure and new administrative steps. Single sign-on in a Web based intranet environment can be achieved using http cookies. This paper analyses cookie security issues and proposes a cookie based single sign-on architecture},

@article{Pashalidis2003,
abstract = {At present, network users have to manage one set of authentication credentials (usually a username/password pair) for every service with which they are registered. Single Sign-On (SSO) has been proposed as a solution to the usability, security and management implications of this situation. Under SSO, users authenticate themselves only once and are logged into the services they subsequently use without further manual interaction. Several architectures for SSO have been developed, each with different properties and underlying infrastructures. This paper presents a taxonomy of these approaches and puts some of the SSO schemes, services and products into that context. This enables decisions about the design and selection of future approaches to SSO to be made within a more structured context; it also reveals some important differences in the security properties that can be provided by various approaches.},

After examining digital pseudonyms and credentials as basic concepts of such a system, we give an introduction to technologies for multilateral security and describe an architecture which enables multilaterally secure communication. By means of different scenarios we show requirements of an identity management system, and outline an approach in developing an identity manager and its infrastructure. Finally, we discuss problems and risks of identity management systems which must be considered when using such a system.},
