abstract = {—Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that maintains a public ledger with all transactions. The public availability of this information has implications for the privacy of the users. The public ledger consists of transactions that transfer funds from a set of inputs to a set of outputs. Both inputs and outputs are linked to Bitcoin addresses. In principle, the addresses are pseudonymous. In practice, it is sometimes possible to link Bitcoin addresses to real identities with the consequent privacy leaks. The possibilities of linking addresses to owners are multiplied when addresses are reused to receive funds multiple times. The reuse of addresses also multiplies the amount of private information that is leaked when an address is linked to a real identity. In this work we describe privacy-leaking effects of address reuse and gather statistics of address reuse in the Bitcoin network. We also describe collaborative (CoinJoin) transactions that prevent the privacy attacks that have been published in the literature. Then we analyze the Blockchain to find transactions that could potentially be CoinJoin transactions.},

abstract = {Federated Identity Management (FIM) amounts to using same set of policies, protocols and practices across different organizations so as to centrally manage users identity. With the increased integration of Internet in our life users, suppliers, retailers all are accessing services of many organizations to increase their business and get the best of what is available, but one organization does not trust the identities of another organization. So the user ends up making several user-IDs and passwords. This is very inefficient, costly and not at all user friendly. FIM provides standards that help the identities to cross organizational boundaries and to be shared by many organizations. FIM allows the subscriber to use the same identity to access networks of different organizations. Some of the first adopters of FIM were Boeing, General Motors and Nokia. This paper includes aspects of FIM including why Federated Identity Management is used how it addresses various problems, its architecture and various standards that are required to enable FIM.},

@article{Radha2012,
abstract = {Single sign-on (SSO) is a mechanism that uses a single action of authentication to permit an authorized user to access all related, but independent software systems or applications without being prompted to log in again at each of them during a particular session. It reduces the risk for the administrators to manage users centrally, increases user productivity by allowing mobility and allows users to access multiple services or applications after being authenticated just once. This doesn't mean that the SSO system unifies account information for all services, applications and systems, rather it hides such a multiplicity of account information into a single account that the user needs to login. Once the user login, the SSO system generates authentication information accepted by the various applications and systems. The concept of SSO can be used within an Intranet, Extranet or Internet. This report explores various methods of SSO and the advantages by adopting it. It also discusses on implementing various types of SSO and the protocols that are being used.},

@inproceedings{Myllyniemi2006,
abstract = {Nowadays, there is a vast amount of work going on in the field of network identity management. Many people in many organizations want to solve the problem of users having to manage countless user accounts, each of which have their own identifier and authentication credentials for a user, as well as a set of attributes that describe the user's identity. The problem applies to the service provider side as well: how to enable collaboration between different services by allowing the users combine two or more services using only one iden-tity, so that the companies offering the services could profit from such collaboration? The user's identities at the service providers either need to be linked, or the user has to have a single identity which he or she can use with various services. In this paper, we present some of the current solutions to the identity management problem, and introduce three cri-teria for comparing identity management systems. The sys-tems discussed are roughly divided into three subcategories to make some kind of comparison possible. Systems in one subcategory have more or less a common viewpoint to the identity management problem, whereas two systems in dif-ferent subcategories might only have one thing in common: they attempt to solve the Web identity management problem in some way.},

@phdthesis{SatoshiNakamoto,
abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

@inproceedings{SAMLSecurity,
abstract = {The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a widely adopted language for making security statements about subjects. It is a critical component for the develop-ment of federated identity deployments and Single Sign-On scenarios. In order to protect integrity and authentic-ity of the exchanged SAML assertions, the XML Signa-ture standard is applied. However, the signature verifica-tion algorithm is much more complex than in traditional signature formats like PKCS{\#}7. The integrity protection can thus be successfully circumvented by application of different XML Signature specific attacks, under a weak adversarial model. In this paper we describe an in-depth analysis of 14 major SAML frameworks and show that 11 of them, including Salesforce, Shibboleth, and IBM XS40, have critical XML Signature wrapping (XSW) vulnerabilities. Based on our analysis, we developed an automated pen-etration testing tool for XSW in SAML frameworks. Its feasibility was proven by additional discovery of a new XSW variant. We propose the first framework to an-alyze such attacks, which is based on the information flow between two components of the Relying Party. Sur-prisingly, this analysis also yields efficient and practical countermeasures.},

@article{OIDCSecurity,
abstract = {OAuth is the new de facto standard for delegating au-thorization in the web. An important limitation of OAuth is the fact that it was designed for authorization and not for authentication. The usage of OAuth for authentication thus leads to serious vulnerabilities as shown by Zhou et. al. in [44] and Chen et. al. in [9]. OpenID Connect was created on top of OAuth to fill this gap by providing federated identity management and user authentication. OpenID Connect was standardized in February 2014, but leading companies like Google, Microsoft, AOL and PayPal are already using it in their web applications [1], [2], [3], [30]. In this paper we describe the OpenID Connect protocol and provide the first in-depth analysis of one of the key features of OpenID Connect: the Discovery and the Dynamic Registration extensions. We present a new class of attacks on OpenID Connect that belong to the category of second-order vulnerabilities. These attacks consist of two phases: First, the injection payload is stored by the legitimate application. Later on, this payload is used in a security-critical operation. Our new class of attacks – called Malicious Endpoints attacks – exploits the OpenID Connect extensions Discov-ery and Dynamic Registration. These attacks break user authentication, compromise user privacy, and enable Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), client-side code injection, and Denial-of-Service (DoS). As a result, the security of the OpenID Connect protocol cannot be guaranteed when these extensions are enabled in their present form. We contacted the authors of the OpenID Connect and OAuth specifications. They acknowledged our Malicious Endpoint attacks and recognized the need to improve the specification [29]. We are currently involved in the discus-sion regarding the mitigation of the existing issues and an extension to the OAuth specification.},

abstract = {Millions of web users today employ their Facebook accounts to sign into more than one million relying party (RP) web-sites. This web-based single sign-on (SSO) scheme is enabled by OAuth 2.0, a web resource authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service providers. The OAuth 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open question. We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unau-thorized access to the victim user's profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer ex-amination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementa-tion simplicity. To improve the security of OAuth 2.0 SSO systems in real-world settings, we suggest simple and practi-cal improvements to the design and implementation of IdPs and RPs that can be adopted gradually by individual sites.},

abstract = {Executive Summary With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor-mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub-lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans-actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi-viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes.},

This work investigates the challenges and concerns web users face when using OpenID for authentication, and identifies what changes in the login flow could improve the users' experience and adoption incentives. We found our participants had several behaviors, concerns, and misconceptions that hinder the OpenID adoption process: (1) their existing password management strategies reduce the perceived usefulness of SSO; (2) many (26{\%}) expressed concerns with single-point-of-failure related issues; (3) most (71{\%}) held the incorrect belief that the OpenID credentials are being given to the content providers; (4) half exhibited an inability to distinguish a fake Google login form, even when prompted; (5) many (40{\%}) were hesitant to consent to the release of their personal profile information; and (6) many (36{\%}) expressed concern with the use of SSO on websites that contain valuable personal information or, conversely, are not trustworthy. We also found that with an improved affordance and privacy control, more than 60{\%} of study participants would use Web SSO solutions on the websites they trust.},

abstract = {At present, network users have to manage one set of authentication credentials (usually a username/password pair) for every service with which they are registered. Single Sign-On (SSO) has been proposed as a solution to the usability, security and management implications of this situation. Under SSO, users authenticate themselves only once and are logged into the services they subsequently use without further manual interaction. Several architectures for SSO have been developed, each with different properties and underlying infrastructures. This paper presents a taxonomy of these approaches and puts some of the SSO schemes, services and products into that context. This enables decisions about the design and selection of future approaches to SSO to be made within a more structured context; it also reveals some important differences in the security properties that can be provided by various approaches.},

abstract = {The shifting of users, applications and management to the cloud, and the acceleration of IT innovation, has forever altered the IAM landscape. In 2017, technical professionals must focus on IAM initiatives that deliver rapid time to value but avoid "technical debt." Key Findings ■ Identity and access management (IAM) initiatives have traditionally required multiyear implementations before delivering full organizational value. But in the digital age, lengthy IAM deployments are unacceptable. In 2017, organizations will deploy agile IAM technologies that deliver business value within 12 months or less. ■ While organizations should focus on time to value in 2017, they should begin initial assessments to exploit the value of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). Recommendations ■ Create scalable Office 365 IAM practices, including on-premises preparation, user management, license management and authentication management. If done correctly, your organization will be successful with Office 365 and future initiatives like infrastructure as a service (IaaS), enterprise mobility management and SaaS single sign-on (SSO) — while reducing costs and improving security. ■ Leverage IaaS virtualized Active Directory (AD) services for "lift-and-shift" application migrations, instead of deploying AD domain controllers into virtual machines. Test your applications in advance because the services are nascent and application incompatibilities may exist. ■ Adopt or migrate to mobile push authentication. Compared to second-generation authentication methods like one-time password devices and SMS, mobile push authentication delivers significant cost reduction while improving usability and security — and offers faster time to value. ■ Incorporate identity analytics capabilities into both admin-time (identity governance and administration [IGA]) and runtime (multifactor authentication [MFA] and SSO) IAM. They are here to stay due to their ability to reduce administrative workload and security risk while improving the end-user experience.},

@inproceedings{Wang2012,
abstract = {With the boom of software-as-a-service and social networking, web-based single sign-on (SSO) schemes are being deployed by more and more commercial websites to safeguard many web resources. Despite prior research in formal verification, little has been done to analyze the security quality of SSO schemes that are commercially deployed in the real world. Such an analysis faces unique technical challenges, including lack of access to well-documented protocols and code, and the complexity brought in by the rich browser elements (script, Flash, etc.). In this paper, we report the first “field study” on popular web SSO systems. In every studied case, we focused on the actual web traffic going through the browser, and used an algorithm to recover important semantic information and identify potential exploit opportunities. Such opportunities guided us to the discoveries of real flaws. In this study, we discovered 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook, JanRain, Freelancer, FarmVille, Sears.com, etc. Every flaw allows an attacker to sign in as the victim user. We reported our findings to affected companies, and received their acknowledgements in various ways. All the reported flaws, except those discovered very recently, have been fixed. This study shows that the overall security quality of SSO deployments seems worrisome. We hope that the SSO community conducts a study similar to ours, but in a larger scale, to better understand to what extent SSO is insecurely deployed and how to respond to the situation.},

abstract = {Identity management is traditionally seen from the service providers' point of view, meaning that it is an activity undertaken by the service provider to manage service user identities. Traditional identity man-agement systems are designed to be cost effective and scalable primarily for the service providers, but not necessarily for the users, which often results in poor usability. Users are, for example, often required to memorise multiple passwords for accessing different services. This represents a minor inconvenience if users only access a few online services. However, with the rapid increase in the uptake of online ser-vices, the traditional approach to identity management is already having serious negative effects on the user experience. The industry has responded by proposing new identity management models to improve the user experience, but in our view these proposals give little relief to users at the cost of relatively high increase in server system complexity. This paper takes a new look at identity management, and proposes solutions that are designed to be cost effective and scalable from the users' perspective, while at the same time being compatible with traditional identity management systems.},
